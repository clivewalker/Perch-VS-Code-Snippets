# Perch VS Code Snippets
 Snippets for Perch template tags and functions.
 
 In VS Code - go to Preferences - User Snippets. Create new Snippets file and copy and paste the contents of perch.code-snippets into that.
 
 Example use, if itâ€™s not obvious, entering `if -> tab` in VS Code will add a Perch If conditional `<perch:if exists=""></perch:if>`.
 
 Each snippet has two shortcuts, one is very short like `if`, the other is a bit longer like `perchif`.
